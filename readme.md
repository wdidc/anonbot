## Local Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:wdidc/anonbot
$ cd anonbot
$ npm install
```

### Get Slack API Token

Visit https://ga-students.slack.com/services/new/bot and create a new bot integration.

Copy the API token.

Create a file named `env.js` in the root of the project:

```js
// env.js

module.exports = {
  token: "###",
  bot_id: "###",
  private_group_id: "###", // The group from which those authorized may @mention the bot
  public_group_id: "###" // The main group to which the bot will be posting
}

```
```
$ node app.js
```

## User

When anyone DMs the bot, it will send the response to the public group headed with the text "[Student]", and to the private group headed with the messagers username.

When anyone @mentions the bot from the "private group", it will send the response to the public group headed with the text "[Instructor]". Presumably, anyone in the private group will be "authorized" to use the bot.

The `h` in `h.js` stands for "helper", as in "helper methods".
